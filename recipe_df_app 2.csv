131,banana oatmeal bread,100513,65,7,"i love bananas and oatmeal, so when i saw this in the september 2004 issue of cooking light, i just knew i had to make it! i wasn't at all disappointed. the oatmeal makes it hearty and somewhat chewy, while the bananas and buttermilk make it sweet and moist - yet it is not as sweet or sticky-moist as some other banana breads i've had. this makes a smaller loaf than some recipes. i made 2 mini-loaves instead of one large one, and they were done in 30-35 minutes.  edited to mention- since i posted this recipe, i've made it several times.  it has become the banana bread recipe for this household, and when i give it as gifts it never fails to receive compliments.  it is extremely versatile also.  i have made it with yogurt in place of buttermilk, walnut oil for the vegetable oil, and i have cut back the sugar and added cinnamon as a couple reviewers suggested.  this last time i made an eggless version by substituting 2 tablespoons ground flax seed + 6 tablespoons water for the eggs.  (i think next time i will try a vegan version by also replacing the buttermilk with soymilk.)  every time it has turned out perfect!","flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, oats, mashed banana, buttermilk, vegetable oil, vanilla, eggs, cooking spray",12,4.48,120,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3
132,banana lemon sensation,64954,80,31,"bet you can't have just one piece! this recipe is the most delicious i have ever made, or developed. of course the basis for a good banana bread was originally developed during the days when our ancestors used the palms of their hands to measure flour, and plain soda as rising agents. i would not recommend this; how things have changed and improved, and i am glad they did. banana bread is a staple in our home; unfortunately i must monitor my personal consumption because of health implications. i am happy to share my recipe with you and know you will enjoy it as much as my own family. to increase the number of loaves, simply multiply the recipe accordingly. because banana/lemon sensation freezes so well, i habitually bake these in large quantities; (up to a dozen loaves), preparing and cooking two at a time. your oven may accommodate more than two loaves at a time, but i have found that any more than two loaves in an oven will result in uneven baking of the product. the loaves at the rear of my oven will overbake while the front loaves are lighter in colour, and will take a little more time for centres to cook. suggest also making more than one loaf; a family of four will polish off an entire loaf at one sitting, because you can't have just one piece! better make several, and put a couple away for future consumption. kids will love the snack after school. you cannot hide anything; the aroma of baking banana/lemon sensation tells all.","bananas, butter, sugar, all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, eggs, lemon rind, lemon, juice of",9,4.5,68,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3

165,best ever banana cake with cream cheese frosting,67256,75,18,"this is one of (if not) the best banana cake i have ever tasted! i thought the oven temp of 275° sounded a little low, but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. i do not know if the little ""freezer trick"" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but i did it, and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. all i know is that i followed this recipe exactly as stated (except that i had no buttermilk, so i subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and i got exceptional results. so moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... i personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o)  depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. i used the full recipe and had some leftover. i sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...to die for! i really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! it got better each day it sat, i always make this cake at least the day before i need or want it.  i was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over again!! so glad i came across this one!! (on another website).


(* * just to update the recipe, (based on some of the reviews), the baking time may vary based on individual ovens. it was right on for my oven, but some others have stated it has taken 1 hour 10 minutes, 1 hour 20 minutes, and my sister just informed me that it took 1 hour 30 minutes in her oven!!!!!)","bananas, lemon juice, flour, baking soda, salt, butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, buttermilk, cream cheese, icing sugar, walnuts",13,4.33,1322,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

**note: please check the sodium content before you choose a ranch dressing mix, because it will affect the flavor! some people have complained it is ""too salty"". please also make sure you are using only a 1 ounce packet; there are other sizes from various manufacturers. too much mix throws off the balance of flavors. my sister and i always use the hidden valley ranch original and we do not have any problems with it :)

note: some reviewers have mentioned that the broth/sauce is very salty. it is important to rinse your corned beef in cold water before cooking it to remove some of the excess salt from the corning process.

458,crunchy noodle salad   award winning,136834,15,12,"asian inspired salad that everyone asks me to bring, make or share. i actually had my voice on tv and won a $320 wok for this recipe! i have updated and modified it to be healthier and easier! hope you like it! submitted for world tour asian and sw catagories as it is very popular here in tx. note: we never liked the 'leftover' salad as the crunchy parts got soggy except for the almonds until i got the bright idea to add the leftover salad to a tortilla and make it into a wrap. (i amaze myself sometimes! lol)
i placed the tortilla/wrapper in a skillet and flipped after the first side was warmed. laid some sliced sandwich meat -whatever you like- on the warmed side and let the new side warm. remove from pan and add leftover salad- drain any dressing from it to get it a little drier. roll up and serve- wow! try adding other stuff to it as well. we liked raisins, dried cranberries, shredded carrots, chopped celery etc...

471,dark chocolate cake,2496,60,17,"while it takes slightly longer to prepare this recipe than a box mix, the resulting moist, delicious cake makes it very worth the little extra time. i consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. this cake is excellent with  both with recipe #261024 and recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (i use recipe #95416 when i'm decorating the cake.) i love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (i store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)
my father adores this cake with recipe #261024 on it. for his birthday, father's day etc. i make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. he keeps them in his freezer for when he wants ""a piece of cake"". he claims they are as good as when they are fresh.

562,finger licking chicken marinade,88939,3,2,"a wonderful marinade for chicken. if you don't have miracle whip, mayonnaise may be substituted. i usually marinate chicken in the marinade at least 30 minutes before cooking. however, i once took chicken sitting in the marinade to a cook-out, and other people there who had brought their own chicken started dipping their chicken in my left-over marinade to coat, then barbecuing right away without waiting for it to marinate. it was still delicious! i've found i can coat over a dozen chicken pieces with a single recipe of the marinade. these days i make this without the tbs of salt when making it just for myself, but people's tolerance for low salt varies widely and so i've posted it the way i've found suits most people best.  i'd say be guided by your own tastes when it comes to amount of salt used.","oil, vinegar, miracle whip, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, pepper, thyme, garlic salt",9,4.58,146,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

592,garlic butter rice,240456,25,15,"i love rice. i  also love garlic and cook with it a lot. it took a few tries to get the correct measurements for this recipe in order to submit it. i don't always use measurements when i cook.  this is very easy to make. this is a very moist and buttery rice with a good,  but not overpowering garlic flavor. for rice with less moisture, use less water and for a less garlicky flavor, use less garlic.  i read in an article on an internet medical site, that if garlic is cooked too long, it loses some of  its healthful benefits. they said not to cook garlic any longer than 3-6 minutes. i have also noticed that it loses some of its flavor if it's cooked too long. therefore,  i add the garlic towards the end of the cooking time to get more of a garlic flavor and more healthful benefits from the garlic.  i will sometimes have this for breakfast with a fried egg. i just put some of the rice on a plate and put a fried egg on it and mix it together. it is really good that way. i also serve the rice with gravy over it as a side dish with some meat.  it is also good just by itself. the chicken bouillon is optional but it adds to the flavor of the rice. if you have to or are watching your sodium intake, you might want to omit the bouillon or use less of it.  i have found that jasmine rice gives the best results for this recipe but you can also use white rice. prep and cooking times are estimates. note: due to the first review, i have edited this recipe. thank you lauralie41,","margarine, white rice, chicken bouillon cubes, water, garlic",5,4.7,61,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

*the liquid will thicken to a glaze if you are patient. it just takes a bit of time. if you feel your chicken is cooked (and going to overcook) remove it before going on to reduce the liquid. same thing, if you must use breast meat, remove it (so it doesn't dry out) and continue reducing the liquid . if you do it this way rather than thickening with cornstarch you will get a richer glaze and not need to add stock or broth instead of the water. it just takes patience. and note: a glaze is sticky and coats the meat, this is not a sauce.","chicken drumsticks, water, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, garlic clove, hot chili pepper",7,4.4,904,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

(i roast my 18-20 lbs. fresh turkey at 250°f. it took about 4 hours to reach the correct temperature in my old convection oven. it took 5 hours in my new one.)

947,nan s classic mustard potato salad,63017,60,18,"i'm always asked to share this recipe, and people are often surprised to see how similar the ingredients are to their own recipe. while the ingredients may be similar to other posted recipes, the technique is the key to this outstanding potato salad. the specific ingredients are important, too. russets absorb the flavors best, but don't hold their shape well. dicing them after they are cold, and folding the other ingredients in gently, takes care of that problem. don't skimp on the mayo and other dressing ingredients. the potatoes will absorb a lot of moisture, and you want a creamy salad. another key to flavor and texture is the very fine chopping of the onion, celery and pickle. you want the flavors to disperse throughout the whole dish, but when you take a bite, you want to bite into potato, not an onion chunk. for smaller apetites and crowds, you can halve the quantity easily.  in louisiana and other states where they serve cajun food, potato salad is often served with gumbo.","russet potatoes, eggs, sweet onions, celery, dill pickle, mayonnaise, mustard, pickle juice, cream, kosher salt, white pepper, sugar",12,4.6,83,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

971,old widow walker s ziploc omelettes,132052,33,13,"mrs. walker was my sunday school teacher and we used to do this in the church kitchen, occasionally. this is my first memory of cooking that i cherish to this day. she keeps her age a closely guarded secret but is rumoured to be 115+ years old and perhaps, immortal. she has out lived three husbands and four children. she is still sharp as the bowie knife she carries in her purse. i don't know why she carries a bowie knife in her purse- but she always has. i asked her about it years ago and she said, ""you would be surprised how often it comes in handy, honey."" i suppose it does, mrs. walker. god bless you. btw- she is thrilled that i want to pass this on to another generation of schoolchildren. she was surprised that i remembered doing this with her over 35 years ago and was touched. when asked how to do it- she rattled off the instructions faster than i could write!

i've eaten this bag-n-boil recipe for 40+ years with no toxicity what-so-ever, obviously. if it was toxic... i would be in too poor of health to type.

i found out this past christmas (2009) that this bakes well without a crust as well.

i had to make 3 pumpkin pies to take to my son's home.  i had enough mixture left over make another pie but not enough pie dough for a 4th pie.  so i spray oiled a round casserole dish, filled with mixture and baked.","pumpkin, brown sugar, granulated sugar, ground cloves, cinnamon, ground ginger, salt, eggs, evaporated milk, heavy cream, unbaked 9-inch pie shells",11,4.68,135,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

988,our daily bread in a crock   weekly make and bake rustic bread,340621,20190,16,"make up a large batch of rustic artisanal bread dough, store it and then bake a loaf each day you need fresh bread, amazing but true! this is a hodge podge of old fashioned english and french rustic bread recipes; the bread dough is made up ahead of time and stored (in the old days) in an earthenware crock or bowl, with a lid. you tear a piece of the dough off as and when you want to bake a loaf of bread. easy! i use this style of bread dough regularly in the b and b, so i can always have fresh bread or bread rolls on hand for breakfast. you can add other types of flour to the basic white batch, as long as the ratio remains the same - you can mix rye or wholewheat flour with the white, or add herbs, onions, seeds, fruit and other flavourings. the dough can be used as soon as the initial proving has finished, but it will keep in a cool place or a fridge for a week or two - i do not recommend longer than 2 weeks however. the dough can be used for free form bread loaves, in bread tins, as rolls or other shapes. i have kept this technique and recipe to myself for a while, but i have decided to share it on zaar now, mainly as my daughter keeps asking for the basic dough recipe! i notice that this type of long-term or long-life bread dough has made a revival in a new book called “artisan bread in five minutes a day”; this recipe however, is a very old technique and method, dough was always made up for the week and then kept in the cold room or pantry for daily baking. my grandmother who lived in a 600 year old cottage in northern england, used to have a stone slab in the pantry where she kept her crock and dough, i remember sticking my finger in it!! this amount makes about 4 to 5 loaves of bread, depending on the weight and shape of the bread that you bake.","warm water, fast rising yeast, sea salt, white bread flour",4,4.59,100,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

1049,perfect pork tenderloin,63828,10,24,"my #1 way to cook a pork tenderloin or a boneless pork loin because it's always moist and tender.  it's easy and foolproof!  if you like, marinate the roast and rub with any seasonings that please your palate! 

so many people have asked me how long to cook tenderloins if they have ""more than one"" to cook, i wanted to give a simple response.  answer:  so long as the tenderloins are not touching each other, cook 3 or 4 individual tenderloins for the same amount of time as if you were cooking one.  remember, each tenderloin is cooking in its own separate space.  example:  if cooking three 1-pound tenderloins, cook them only 5-1/5 minutes total.   this makes it a great entree recipe when having a dinner party for 8-12 people, or more.

to clarify the directions since one reviewer mentioned that they had a problem with their first batch: make sure that your machine's dough cycle includes the rising time!  i thought everyone's did, but apparently not.  (my own personal machine mixes up the ingredients and then there's a total rise time of a little over an hour (closer to 1.5 hours).  so, if you think your abm just mixes things up but doesn't allow for rising time, add a 2 hour (approx) rise time between steps 1 and 2.  if your machine's dough cycle does have a built in rising time, then you're all set, and you can follow the instructions exactly, no need for extra rising time.

1117,real english fish and chips with yorkshire beer batter,183399,60,22,"i was taught how to cook fish and chips by my mum when i was about 12 years old; we were living in hong kong at the time and it was my mum's way of treating us to a little bit of home as a treat! my mum had this recipe written down on the back of an old envelope stuck inside her be-ro cookbook from 1952 - i never use any other method now! one trick is to make sure that everything is prepared and assembled ready for frying takeoff!!! if you are cooking for two or more people, have your oven on with a lined tray to keep the fish and chips warm. if you really want to be totally authentic, cut up squares of greaseproof paper and sheets of newspaper - place the fish and chips onto the greaseproof paper and then into a sheet of newspaper. all you need now is a pickled onion, salt and malt vinegar!
tips for chips: i notice one reviewer had difficulty with the chips. here are a few tips or tricks for chips: make sure they are dried thoroughly. make sure the fat is very hot - 190 degrees c. certain potatoes are better for chipping, such as king edwards, desiree, majestic, maris piper, and romano. you can soak the chips for an hour before the first frying - it extracts excess starch, which helps in the ""crisping"" process! always drain them thoroughly before serving. i hope these tips will help!","cod fish fillets, plain flour, bicarbonate of soda, beer, lemon, juice of, salt & pepper, flour, potatoes, cooking fat",9,4.61,125,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6

important:  take your roast out of the fridge, and let it set to get it to room temperature before baking!

if you like really rare bake for 15 mins. at 500.  

if you like your roast beef cooked med-rare, put in for 18 mins. at 500.

if you like it well done, then just burn the darn thing lol.

what's nice about this roast is, if someone likes it done a little more, please keep in mind that the end pieces will be done a little more.


***(the roast in the series of photos that i took was a 2.75 lb. bottom of the round roast.  i baked it at 500 for 15 mins., then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for 1 hour for a rare roast.)

1242,southern scalloped potatoes,60160,50,9,"this delicious casserole hasn't been 
compromised by garlic and some other 
seasonings to detract from the traditional southern flavor, or gunked up with cheese to turn it into a gratin or doria. we enjoy this authentic southern dish year-round, so good in its creamy simplicity and subtle flavors.  my family always expects it for christmas dinner alongside the ham and cranberry chutney. be your own judge regarding measurements. i learned from my grandmother and she never measured, so i've learned to guestimate on many of my recipes.

note: this dish can easily be frozen after baking, then thawed out and reheated.  i do not recommend freezing without baking first, since potatoes will sometimes get mushy if frozen uncooked.  i personally do not like a tin baking pan for this particular recipe, especially for freezing, since it can sometimes impart a ""tinny"" taste. also, if this recipe is baked in a glass baking dish and then frozen, the glass will shatter if not at room temperature.  so, if  freezing in a glass baking dish, i recommend baking and freezing in corning ware since it will not break.","idaho potatoes, onions, butter, flour, milk, salt and pepper",6,4.73,51,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

1348,the clockmaker s caramel coated popcorn  a haunted recipe,181870,15,8,"in 1921, a german born clockmaker quit his well respected job to open a popcorn stand in chicago’s wicker park district. the clockmaker’s typical fare was freshly popped popcorn drizzled with warm butter and sprinkled with salt; but his favorite, and most beloved popcorn, was his caramel coated popcorn. the recipe he used to make it was given to him from his only true love, who tragically died four years earlier during world war i. the tattered and torn recipe, which was scribbled on the inside of an old playbill, was carefully framed and sealed in an exquisite frame. the clockmaker faithfully took the framed recipe with him everywhere he went.  

by the summer of 1924, the clockmaker’s caramel coated popcorn had captivated the entire city’s attention; everyone was frantically lining up at his busy stand to buy the sweet, sticky confection. a few months later, just as the clockmaker was preparing to close his stand for the day, a small fire ignited near the stove. the clockmaker instinctively ran out to call for help. when he returned, just seconds later, he remembered leaving the framed recipe hanging on the wall. the clockmaker quickly ran into the burning stand to retrieve the recipe, but he never made it out.

when the fire inspectors went into the charred ruins to investigate the accident, they found the clockmaker’s frame lying in a pile of smoking debris. the frame was in pristine condition; not a dent, nor a blemish, could be seen on it. however, the recipe was gone.  

the recipe for the clockmaker’s caramel popcorn recently surfaced and is beginning to circulate around the globe. unfortunately, many people think the recipe is haunted because it is believed that if your clock stops running after making the recipe it’s because the clockmaker has paid you a visit in hopes of reclaiming his long, lost recipe.

note:  this recipe, as written, results in a sticky, chewy caramel popcorn.  if you prefer a crunchier caramel popcorn, bake it in the oven at 250 degrees for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.","margarine, brown sugar, karo syrup, salt, baking soda, vanilla, popped popcorn",7,4.65,54,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

a few baking tips i have learned from making this recipe often: i use a jelly roll pan so the granola will have maximum exposure while cooking.  also, if you do like your granola to clump, do not stir while baking.  allow to cool in pan for about 10 minutes or so, then run a spatula between granola and the pan to loosen.  you will have so many clumps you will have to break them with your hands ; )","vegetable oil cooking spray, old fashioned oats, sliced almonds, golden brown sugar, salt, ground cinnamon, vegetable oil, honey, sugar, vanilla extract",10,4.67,139,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

1430,very moist banana nut bread,82486,65,10,"this is a very easy, ""no mixer"" bread to make. it is very moist and a little heavy type banana bread. the really important thing to remember is using all black bananas to get my same results. i always use 5 medium sized bananas and this recipe makes 2 loaves. also, i've never used buttermilk, but sour milk instead..a little vinegar added to regular milk. i've used this recipe since 1972 and last year made 32 loaves to give away for christmas! it's truly a wonderful bread. i only bake it until the toothpick comes out almost clean, as we like it really moist. if you over bake it, or wait til the toothpick is completely clean, the bread will be a lot dryer. i realize some like it this way, so thats why i've given this hint. my family and friends would rather have it a little under done than over. it's so good with coffee, butter/jelly or i like mine just plain. i bake it in tin foil pans and it freezes wonderfully. i try to always have one or two in the freezer for company, or a little gift. this recipe came from a ladies club cookbook. the kind where everyone contributes recipes, they are made into a recipe book and sold to make money for charities. all the cooks are just plain ""down home"" country gals that produce miracles in the kitchen. it's my favorite cookbook and i've almost worn it out and it can't be replaced. i know there are many banana bread recipes here, so thanks for trying this recipe. i hope you enjoy it!","sugar, salt, flour, vegetable oil, eggs, vanilla, baking soda, buttermilk, pecans, bananas",10,4.33,252,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3
